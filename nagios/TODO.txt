Important things that will have to be done in the future:

-Enlarge the plugin to make it possible to get all the metrics of Nagios
-At the moment it is limited to only a few metrics because there is a bug in the parser that has to be fixed first
-Refactoring of the data model to find out if there are possibilities to improve the whole thing
-Update wiki documentation to include the latest changes
-More logging output for debug purpose in all the classes
